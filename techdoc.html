              <p>The CSS grid is a somewhat new way of organizing content on a web page. Being 2018,
              most web browsers are finally supporting the grid among many other features of CSS3.</p>
              <p>By the very limited knowledge of the creator of this very document you are reading you,
              by the end of this documnet, should have the knowledge to begin using the grid in your
              next web project.</p>

              <p>By stumbling upon this document, it may or may not be safe to assume you have an idea
              of how to build a basic website using HTML and CSS. At the very least you should learn
              the basics of these programming languages before you begin trying to understand what the
              CSS grid is all about. So if you do not have an understanding of the basics now would be the
              time to do that.</p>
              <p>Seeing that you are reading this, it must be safe to assume that you are ready. (I could
                be wrong) But so long as you really do understand what's going on, let's get started.</p>

            <article>
              Where to begin? Here's a list of things we'll cover in the order that we'll cover them.<br>
              <ul>
                <li>display: grid;</li>
                <li>grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows</li>
                <li>grid-template-areas and grid-area;</li>
                <li>grid: gap;</li>
                <li>justify-content and align-content</li>
              </ul>
              <section class="sub-section">
              <h3>display: grid;</h3>
              <article><code>.grid { <p style="margin-left:1em;"><b>display: grid;</b> <br>grid-template-columns: 150px auto; <br>grid-template-rows: auto; <br>grid-gap: 1em;<br>justify-content: stretch;<br>align-content: center;</p>}</code></article><br>
              The code above is an example of a class being displayed as a grid. The class is of course being designated to a "div" element. What I want to focus on, though, is "display: grid;".
              What this bit of code is doing is allowing you to display information in a two-dimensional grid; in rows and columns. This is great as it creates flexibility and a straight-forward
              way of aligning and adjusting content on whatever website you're building. But what do we do once we've displayed a class as a grid?
              </section>
              <section class="sub-section">
              <h3>grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows</h3>
              <article><code>.grid { <p style="margin-left:1em;">display: grid; <b><br>grid-template-columns: 150px auto; <br>grid-template-rows: auto;</b> <br>grid-gap: 1em;<br>justify-content: stretch;<br>align-content: center;</p>}</code></article><br>
              It's time to start building the grid! Now that a class is being displayed as a grid we can begin to modify the layout of the grid. This is done by "grid-template-columns" and "grid-template-rows". In the example above we find "grid-template-columns: 150px auto;".
              This is declaring that there will be only two columns, the first of which is only 150px across, and the second is set to "auto", which will automatically fill the rest of the space that is available.<br><br>
              As you might have guessed, it's the same conecept for grid-template-rows. But it's good to keep in mind that "auto" is only one of your options for measurement, not only in rows, but in columns as well. Some other measurement options include
              "em", "px", and "fr". The measurement "fr" is new to CSS and it stands for fraction. It basically does the math for you so that you don't have to define your column widths with crazy percents.
            </article>
            <section class="sub-section">
            <h3>grid-template-areas and grid-area</h3>
            <article><code>.grid { <p style="margin-left:1em;">display: grid; <br> grid-template-areas: <br>"header header header"<br>"content content content"<br>"footer footer footer";</p>}</code></article><br>
            This section won't be quite so straight forward. But don't worry. It's not complicated. The grid-template-areas are built of classes that have a specified grid-area. Let's focus on "header header header" in the example above. This line of code describe's how a grid-area
            will act along a row, and it also defines that there is 3 columns in the grid. But wait, it gets cooler. If we instead wanted to for some reason move the footer right next to the header, and create a fourth column, we could instead write:<br><br>
            <article><code>.grid { <p style="margin-left:1em;">display: grid; <br> grid-template-areas: <br>"header header footer footer"<br>"content content content content"</p>}</code></article><br>
            Crazy, right? More like crazy awesome! The ability to move content around like this on a page is something new to CSS. It makes laying out a page much easier and neater.
            </section>
            <section class="sub-section">
            <h3>grid-gap;</h3>
            <article><code>.grid { <p style="margin-left:1em;">display: grid; <br>grid-template-columns: 150px auto; <br>grid-template-rows: auto; <b><br>grid-gap: 1em;</b><br>justify-content: stretch;<br>align-content: center;</p>}</code></article><br>
            So, this section should be short and sweet. The "grid-gap" is exaclty what is sounds like. It's what defines the space between each "child" or "cell" in a grid. Play around with this feature. It'll make your content look clean and organized.
            </section>
            <section class="sub-section">
            <h3>justify-content and align-content</h3>
            <article><code>.grid { <p style="margin-left:1em;">display: grid; <br>grid-template-columns: 150px auto; <br>grid-template-rows: auto; <br>grid-gap: 1em; <b><br>justify-content: stretch;<br>align-content: center;</b></p>}</code></article><br>
            Last, but not least, we'll learn how to move the content around within each cell. The attribute "justify-content" refers to the horizontal positioning of the content within a cell, and the attribute "align-content" refers to the vertical position
            of the content within a cell. There are multiple options for how we might postion the content, such as "center", "start", "end", and "stretch".
