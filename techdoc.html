              <p>The CSS grid is a somewhat new way of organizing content on a web page. Being 2018,
              most web browsers are finally supporting the grid among many other features of CSS3.</p>
              <p>By the very limited knowledge of the creator of this very document you are reading you,
              by the end of this documnet, should have the knowledge to begin using the grid in your
              next web project.</p>

              <p>By stumbling upon this document, it may or may not be safe to assume you have an idea
              of how to build a basic website using HTML and CSS. At the very least you should learn
              the basics of these programming languages before you begin trying to understand what the
              CSS grid is all about. So if you do not have an understanding of the basics now would be the
              time to do that.</p>
              <p>Seeing that you are reading this, it must be safe to assume that you are ready. (I could
                be wrong) But so long as you really do understand what's going on, let's get started.</p>
